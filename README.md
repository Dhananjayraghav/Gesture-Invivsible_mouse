# Gesture-Invivsible_mouse
Powered by sorcerous algorithms (MediaPipe) and ethereal whispers (OpenCV), this project captures the subtle movements of your handâ€”transforming them into silent commands that ripple through the digital void. The cursor becomes an extension of your intent, gliding across the screen like a specter obeying its summoner.
